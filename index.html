<h2>HTML</h2>

    <li>Semantic HTML is the name of elements that describe its content and role it plays on a webpage.</li>
    <li>Not all elements are semantic.</li>
    <li>It's best practice to use semantic elements wherever possible.</li>

   < <h2>CSS</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
    <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
    <li>* selector is a wild card symbol that declares all the elements of the page will have the style properties set at "".</li>
    <li>You can combine 2 selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma allowing the declarations to affect both selectors.</li>
    <li>You need to link the CSS to the HMTL file.</li>
    <li>Add style by using class attributes.</li>
    <li>Class attributes can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned to the CSS rule.</li>
    <li>Card - designates this a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class card will gain these property assignments.</li>
    <li>Assigning colours in CSS can be done in many ways including semantic references such as "grey" or we can also refer to a colour by its hexadecimal colour.</li>
